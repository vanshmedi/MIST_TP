# 3.2 Frequency Analysis
**Goal:** Decode a short text where emoji/symbols map to letters using frequency analysis and manual mapping.
The scripts have been uploaded in the folder

**How it works**
_Load file_ — Reads the source ciphertext (emoji/symbols).

_Limit preview_ — Only first 2000 characters are decoded for quick iteration; remove the slice to decode the full file.

_Mapping_ — A dictionary maps the emoji tokens to plaintext letters. This mapping was created via frequency analysis and iterative substitutions.

_Substitute_ — Each character is replaced according to the mapping; unknown tokens become ?.

_Inspect_ — The decoded preview + token frequency list help refine the mapping.

**Decoded preview**

After applying the mapping, the decoded preview begins to show English text with readable names/phrases. Example extracted lines:

…THEN? CATCHING SIGHT OL STEPHEN DEDAFUS? HE WENT TOWARDS HIM AND MADE RAPID CROSSES IN THE AIR? GURGFING IN HIS THROAT AND SHA?ING HIS HEAD? STEPHEN DEDAFUS? DISPFEASED AND SFEEPY? FEANED HIS ARMS ON THE TOP OL THE STAIRCASE…

Key observation: the phrase “STEPHEN DEDAFUS” (in the decoded text — normalized to STEPHEN DEDALUS) appears clearly.

Conclusion / source identification
_"The presence of Stephen Dedalus strongly indicates the source text is Ulysses by James Joyce (Stephen Dedalus being a central character in Ulysses and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man). The quoted excerpt '_

Looking at a snippet of clear text from the decoded string and reserching about Ulysses:
_“Solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. He faced about and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrounding land and the awaking mountains. Then, catching sight of Stephen Dedalus, he bent towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat and shaking his head. Stephen Dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.”
― James Joyce, Ulysses_
